Analyze changes and plan a set of coherent commits. Add changes and commit with
descriptive messages.

Be very mindful about what files you stage, be sure that you're not compromising
sensitivie information. It is absolutely forbidden to stage .env files, except
.env.example files, or other types of files that might contain secrets.

Before committing files, make sure that they do not expose sensitive data, like
connection strings, passwords, or API keys.
